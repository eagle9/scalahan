Brian goetz on evolving Java language

project amber --- language asceptects
  type inference with var, use good variable name
  not just lambda from scala jdk 8
  but also new in jdk 11
	switch case -> ...., no break you might forget
    record class, that is case class object from scala, huge to reduce boilercode
	pattern matching, again from scala
       if isinstanceOf ClassA.... --->
			switch (a) {
				case Integer i: 
		reduced lines of code/repetition, avoid errors
	sealed type, scala too

project valhalla aims to reboot the layout of data in memory
  value types, no object header, no pointer/ref, no oop 
  but can have methods, fields, implement interfaces
   use encapsulation, can be generic
  faster objects
  user-defined primities

project loom 
  threads are heavy, need lighter concurrency primitives
